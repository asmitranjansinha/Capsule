    <string name="note_body">\nBlood flow in the heart follows a specific pathway, ensuring efficient circulation throughout the body:\n\n\n1. Right Atrium: Deoxygenated blood returns from the body to the heart through the superior and inferior vena cavae, entering the right atrium.\n2.Tricuspid Valve: From the right atrium, blood flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle.\n3. Right Ventricle: The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, which carries it to the lungs for oxygenation.\n4. Pulmonary Arteries and Capillaries: In the lungs, blood releases carbon dioxide and picks up oxygen through the process of gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries.\n5. Pulmonary Veins: Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium.\n6. Mitral Valve: Blood passes through the mitral valve from the left atrium into the left ventricle.\n7. Left Ventricle: The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, which distributes it to the rest of the body.</string>
